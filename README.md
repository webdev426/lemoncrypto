Hi, I'm @lemoncrypto.
I'm looking for full-time remote developer position at blockchain & cryptocurrency fields.
I am interested in blockchain field.
I have many skills to contribute including Blockchain, CryptoCurrency. Especially focusing on the smart contract in these days.
Previously, I worked at archidax exchange site development. And I developed several trading bots, forked coins. In recent days, I've cloned new swaps from Uni-Swap, Sushi-Swap and Pancake Swap.
Thanks for watching!
